# Genesis.DisconnectedUtil

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/h40wp7mblm3c984x?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/kentcb/genesis-disconnectedutil)

## What?

> All Genesis.* projects are formalizations of small pieces of functionality I find myself copying from project to project. Some are small to the point of triviality, but are time-savers nonetheless. They have a particular focus on performance with respect to mobile development, but are certainly applicable outside this domain.
 
**Genesis.TestDisconnected** is a simple library containing helpers for [disconnected layers](http://kent-boogaart.com/blog/disconnected-layers). It is delivered as a PCL targeting a wide range of platforms, including:

* .NET 4.5
* Windows 8
* Windows Store
* Windows Phone 8
* Xamarin iOS
* Xamarin Android

## Why?

I have found myself copying a bunch of helper code from disconnected layer to disconnected layer. This project wraps that functionality up in a package that I can install instead.

## Where?

The easiest way to get **Genesis.DisconnectedUtil** is via [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Genesis.DisconnectedUtil/):

```PowerShell
Install-Package Genesis.DisconnectedUtil
```

## How?

Just install **Genesis.DisconnectedUtil** and explore the available helpers.

## Who?
